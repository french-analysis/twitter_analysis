Hi I'm Victor!
This repo will host different manipulations with the Twitter API.
The goal is to collect meaningful data and apply machine learning techniques to extract relevant conclusions. This sentence is a guideline to what we want to do, but has abslutely no content.

Here are a few of the use cases that we will keep in mind. Given a twitter user, a politic for example, we want to build a tool that will help him draw conclusions on his twitter presence, and enable him to take action given this insights.
  - What communities can we spot among his followers?
  - What topics are sensitive topics?

Building such an app is not easy, the design below gives a general idea of how we will process.

![Solution Design](https://github.com/french-analysis/twitter_analysis/blob/master/Solution%20design.jpg)

1) Build the backend server
  * Define the needed data
  * Setup the twitter API
  * Retrieve the needed Data
2) Run the analytics
  * Define 
  * Define the tools and algorithms that we are using, why each of them is useful
  * Implement them
3) Produce reports and visualizations illustrating these results
